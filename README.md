# SUDOKU
This C code implements a Sudoku puzzle game with functions for generating and printing the grid, validating moves, solving puzzles using backtracking, and allowing user interaction. The 9x9 grid features placeholders for empty cells and employs a backtracking algorithm for solving. Additionally, it includes a method to generate solvable Sudoku puzzles. Users can input values interactively, and the program validates inputs based on Sudoku rules.

In summary, the code provides a comprehensive implementation of a Sudoku game in C, demonstrating how to create, solve, and interact with Sudoku puzzles programmatically.

How to run , what to input & what to expect to see as a result -

To run the code, compile it in a C compiler or on Linux. Upon execution, you will be prompted to set a difficulty level. The program will then generate a Sudoku puzzle accordingly. You'll input three numbers: the row, column, and the number to place. If valid, the program updates the puzzle and displays the result.
